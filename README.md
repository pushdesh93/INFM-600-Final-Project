# INFM-600-Final-Project
This repository contains the code for the data cleaning. This script was used to import the data from .xls and then convert it to csv format.
The raw data was available in .xls formats containing multiple tabs. 
This script imports the data file.
Each tab is separated using a loop and then the data is parsed and stored in pandas dataframes.
The script also helps group the data based on the declared column names. This helps analyzing the data for multiple video files together.
